What is subtraction?,"Subtraction can be labelled as the inverse of addition. It computes the difference between two values, i.e., the minuend minus the subtrahend. The operator of subtraction is (-)."
What is multiplication?,"Multiplication also combines two values like addition and subtraction, into a single value or product. The two original values are known as the multiplicand and the multiplier, or simply both as factors."
what is division?,"The division is the inverse of multiplication. The operator used for the division method is ?? or ?/? sometimes. It computes the quotient of two numbers, the dividend that is divided by the divisor."
What is arithmetic sequence?,"An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers, where the difference between one term and the next is a constant. For example, 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, ? is an arithmetic sequence with common difference equal to 3. It is also termed arithmetic progression and is commonly represented as: a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, a + 4d, ???. ,a + (n ? 1) d
Where, 
a = first term
d = common difference between the terms
n = number of terms"
What is arithmetic in maths?,"Arithmetic is one of the branches of mathematics which deals with different types of numbers like odd numbers, whole numbers, even numbers, etc. and their basic operations involve addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division."
What are the arithmetic operators?,"The four basic arithmetic operators are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (?) and division ()."
What are the properties of operation in arithmetic?,"There are four main properties of operations which include: Commutative Property, Associative Property, Distributive Property, Additive Identity"

What does the midpoint theorem state?,The midpoint theorem states that ?The line segment in a triangle joining the midpoint of two sides of the triangle is said to be parallel to its third side and is also half of the length of the third side.?
What is the midpoint theorem and converse of the Midpoint Theorem?,"The midpoint theorem states that ?The line segment in a triangle joining the midpoint of two sides of the triangle is said to be parallel to its third side and is also half of the length of the third side.?, Converse: The line drawn through the midpoint of one side of a triangle, parallel to another side bisects the third side."
What is the definition of midpoint in proofs?,"In geometry, the midpoint is defined as the point which divides the line segment into two equal parts."
What does midpoint mean?,"Midpoint means a point which lies at or near the middle or equidistant from both ends of the line segment. In other words, the midpoint is the position of a fact which is halfway between the beginning and the end."
What are the main branches of pure mathematics?,"The main branches of pure mathematics are: Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Calculus, Statistics and Probability"
What are the Branches of Mathematics for higher classes?,"Mathematics in higher classes involves the following types: Analysis, Discrete Maths, Applied Mathematics, Cartesian Geometry, Matrix Algebra, Combinatorics, Topology, Order theory"

What is arithmetic in mathematics?,"It is the oldest and the most elementary among other branches of mathematics. It deals with numbers and the basic operations- addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, between them."
What is geometry in mathematics?,"It is the most practical branch of mathematics that deals with shapes and sizes of figures and their properties. The basic elements of geometry are points, lines, angles, surfaces and solids."
What is trigonometry in mathematics?,"Derived from two Greek terms, i.e., trigon (means a triangle) and metron (means measurement), it is the study of relationships between angles and sides of triangles."
What is analysis in mathematics?, It is the branch that deals with the study of the rate of change in different quantities. Calculus forms the base of analysis.
What is algebra in mathematics?,"It is a kind of arithmetic where we use unknown quantities along with numbers. These unknown quantities are represented by letters of the English alphabet such as X, Y, A, B, etc. or symbols. The use of letters helps us to generalize the formulas and rules and also helps you find the unknown missing values in the algebraic expressions and equations."

What are the factors?,"When a number is said to be a factor of any other second number, then the first number must divide the second number completely without leaving any remainder. In simple words, if a number (dividend) is exactly divisible by any number (divisor), then the divisor is a factor of that dividend. Every number has a common factor that is one and the number itself. For example, 4 is a factor of 24, i.e. 4 divides 24 exactly giving 6 as quotient and leaving zero as remainder. Alternatively, 6 is also a factor of 24 as it gives 4 as quotient on division. Therefore, 24 has 1, 24, 4, 6 as its factors in addition to 2, 3, 8 and 12 and all these numbers divide 24 exactly leaving no remainder."

What are the multiples?,"A multiple of a number is a number that is the product of a given number and some other natural number. Multiples can be observed in a multiplication table. Multiples of some numbers are as follows: Multiples of 2 are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, and so on Hence, multiples of 2 will be even numbers and will end with 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8."

What is meant by divisibility rules?,"A divisibility test is an easy way to identify whether the given number is divided by a fixed divisor without actually performing the division process. If a number is completely divided by another number, then the quotient should be a whole number and the remainder should be zero."
What is the divisibility rule for 2 and 5?,"Divisibility rule for 2: The last/unit digit of the given number should be an even number or the multiples of 2. (i.e.,) 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8. Divisibility Rule for 5: The unit digit of the given number should be 0 or 5."
What is the divisibility rule for 7 and give an example?,"The difference between twice the unit digit of the given number and the remaining part of the given number should be a multiple of 7 or it should be zero. For example, 147 is divisible by 7. Here, the unit digit is 7. When it is multiplied by 2, we get 14, and the remaining part is 14. Therefore, the difference between 14 and 14 is 0."
Write down the divisibility rule for 9.,"The sum of the digits of the given number should be divisible by 9. For example, 2979 is divisible by 9. (i.e.,) 2+9+7+9 = 27, which is divisible by 9."
What is the divisibility rule for 13?,"The sum/addition of four times of the unit digit and the remaining part of the given number should be a multiple of 13. For example, 1092 is divisible by 13. Here, the unit digit is 2. When it is multiplied by 4, we get 8, and the remaining part of the number is 109. Hence, the sum of 109 and 8 is 117, which is divisible by 13."
What is concept of ratio ?,"The concept of ratio and proportion explains how to solve ratios, types of ratios, ratio formula, etc. A ratio is a mathematical expression of comparing two similar or different quantities by division. This expression can be expressed from ratio to percentage form by conversion method. It is denoted by ?:? symbol. For example, 2:3, 5:6, 3:7, etc. are ratios. It is also represented by ?/? symbol. Hence, the ratio is basically a type of division method."
